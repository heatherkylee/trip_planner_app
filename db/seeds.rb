# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


# new_place = Place.find_by(google_id: "eeeee")
# if new_place
#   p "This is already in the table"
#   # render "show.json.jbuilder"
# else
#   @place = Place.new(google_id: "eeeee")
#   @place.save
#   p "New place saved to the table"
#   # render "show.json.jbuilder"
# end
